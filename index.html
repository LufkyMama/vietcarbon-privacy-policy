        described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        This information is used solely for estimating your CO₂ emissions, generating charts,
        and providing personalized tips and challenges.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>

      </ul>

      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information to

        protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or others.
